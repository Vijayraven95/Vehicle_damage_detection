Car Damage Detection App
========================

This project is a **Car Damage Detection** system built using **Detectron2** and **Mask R-CNN** for object detection. The application is capable of detecting various types of car damage, such as minor dents, scratches, and severe damages, and allows users to visualize the results via a **Streamlit** interface, with a **FastAPI** backend for inference.

Project Architecture
--------------------

*   **Mask R-CNN**: A powerful instance segmentation model used for detecting car damage and classifying the type of damage.
    
*   **Detectron2**: A high-performance object detection library by Facebook AI.
    
*   **FastAPI**: Provides the backend API for model inference and integration.
    
*   **Streamlit**: Serves the frontend to interact with the model, upload images, and visualize results.
    
*   **Docker**: The app is fully containerized for easy deployment and reproducibility.

Setup and Usage
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. You can download and install it from here.
    

### Build the Docker Image

1.  ``` git clone <this repo>``` &  ```cd car-damage-detection-app```
    
2.  ```docker build -t car-damage-detection-app .```   

### Run the Application

Run the container with FastAPI and Streamlit:

``` docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 car-damage-detection-app sh -c "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 & streamlit run /app/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501 --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection=false"```
### Access the Application

*   **FastAPI**: Open http://localhost:8000/docs to view the FastAPI Swagger UI for testing the API.
    
*   **Streamlit**: Open http://localhost:8501 to upload images and visualize the damage detection results.

### How to Use the API

* **Predict Damage (API)**:
    
    *   Endpoint: /predict
        
    *   Method: POST
        
    *   Description: Upload an image and get predictions in JSON format (bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores).
        
    *   ```curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -F "file=@path\_to\_image.jpg"```
        
* **Predict and Visualize (API)**:
    
    *   Endpoint: /predict\_and\_visualize
        
    *   Method: POST
        
    *   Description: Upload an image, run inference, and get the image back with bounding boxes and class labels drawn on it.
        
    ``` curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict\_and\_visualize" -F "file=@path\_to\_image.jpg" ```
        

### How to Use Streamlit

1.  Open http://localhost:8501.
    
2.  Upload an image of a car with potential damage.
    
3.  Choose either "Predict" (to get JSON output) or "Predict and Visualize" to see the results directly on the image.
    

Dependencies
------------

* **Python 3.9**
    
* **Detectron2**: For object detection and instance segmentation.
    
* **FastAPI**: Backend API.
    
* **Streamlit**: Frontend UI for image upload and visualization.
    
* **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework.
    
* **Docker**: Containerization.

Improvement Areas
-----------------

### MLOps Improvements:

1. **Model Training and Tracking**: Integrate with **Weights and Biases (W&B)** or **MLflow** for model tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and performance monitoring during training.
    
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Consider deploying the model to a cloud provider like AWS, heroku, or Azure for scalability and availability.
    
3. **Model Monitoring**: Add model performance monitoring with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track data drift or model performance degradation over time.
    
4. **Automated Retraining with Airflow**: Implement **Airflow** pipelines for retraining the model if data drift or model drift is detected.
    
5. **Model Versioning**: Keep track of multiple versions of the model and serve the best-performing version using a model registry.

6. Adding **Kubernetes** provides a way to manage containerized applications (like FastAPI and Streamlit in Docker) at scale. It allows for:
        
        *   **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatically scale your application to handle more traffic by running more instances of the application.
            
        *   **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple containers, improving performance and reducing the chance of overloading one service.
            
        *   Automatically restart of failed containers and ensure your application stays online.
            
7. **Modularizing the Docker Setup**:
    
    *   Currently, **FastAPI** and **Streamlit** are running in a single Docker container, which can lead to issues like difficulty scaling different components, managing dependencies, and monitoring performance independently.
        
    *   **Suggestion**:
        
        *   **Separate Docker Containers for FastAPI and Streamlit**:
            
            *   **FastAPI** can handle model inference and API requests independently, while **Streamlit** can be responsible for the frontend interaction. This allows each service to scale independently based on demand.
            
            *   **Microservices Approach**: By splitting them into different services, you can manage their lifecycle independently, deploy them individually, and update them without affecting the other.
